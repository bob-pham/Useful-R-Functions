A collection of R functions that make certain calculations simpler. Built on top of pre-existing R functions. 

Copy + Paste into RStudio or similar

## Functions For Calculating:
 - Standard Error for Sample Proportions/Means/Independent Groups
 - Test Statistic for Sample Proportions/Means (unknown SD)/Independent Groups/Dependent Groups
 - Test Statistic for Analysis of Variance
 - Confidence intervals for Sample Proportion (with + without SE)
 - Confidence intervals for Sample Means (with + without SE, known/unknown population SD)
 - Confidence intervals for Independent Groups 
 - Margin of Error (from Confidence Level)
 - Minimum Sample size given margin of error
 - Regression Line Model Slope + Intercepts
